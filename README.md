# [Newgrounds](https://newgrounds.com) Audio Downloader ![(Python 3+)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3+-blue.svg) ![Windows XP+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-XP+-brightgreen.svg)

Well, usually there's a download button on the audio page, but what to do if direct downloads are not allowed by the creator even though you love this song too much?

You just use **this**.

You can also read the [Russian README](README-RU.md#newgrounds-audio-downloader--) or [Japanese README](README-JP.md#newgrounds-audio-downloader--).

## So, what do I actually need?

- ![(Python 3+)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3+-blue.svg)
- `PyQt5` library
- `requests` library
- `bs4` library
- `click` library

Or you just use the `.exe` file from [`NGAudioDownloader.zip`](NGAudioDownloader.zip) so all you need is ![Windows XP+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-XP+-brightgreen.svg).

## Let's get it started!

### I'm a civilian

You just download [`NGAudioDownloader.zip`](https://github.com/H1K0/NGAudioDownloader/raw/master/NGAudioDownloader.zip), extract it somewhere and run the `NGAudioDownloader.exe`.

<big>â€»NOTE:</big> if you want this downloader working correctly **DO NOT move/delete** any files extracted from the archive!

### I'm a pythonist

You just [download the whole repository](https://github.com/H1K0/NGAudioDownloader/archive/master.zip) and run `NGAudioDownloader.py`. That's all. :3

## What should I do then?

It's easy as pie. You just run the downloader, enter your song ID and your file is being downloaded!

### Where should I press?

- `Enter` starts download
- `Alt + S` calls settings dialog
- `F1` calls help

## Is there any video guide?

Well, pythonists are considered already understanding how it all works, so here's the [video guide for civilians](https://yadi.sk/i/9krScj2BHcr3Rg).
